# /Qfiles directory

* This folder is full of Q files, as the name suggests.
* `Main.x` is the one that will be executed at runtime
* `archive.l` is an archive of Q code, see [the archive section](#archive) for more
* `UnitTest.l` is a library file for Q, this may or may not be updated, but contains pertinent things to the latest Q
  version, testing software and code for functionality.

# archive

As Q changes more and more, I like to keep a record of how older versions of the language looked. Typically none of that
code will work except for later updates. Scroll down to the bottom to look at code for reference, code near the top will
not function.

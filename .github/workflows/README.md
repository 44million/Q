# Workflows

These workflows help keep Q's GitHub repository running smoothly.

`q.yml` essentially just verifies that the Q installation script is functioning properly, and can be executed without problems.


`maven-linux`, and `maven-macos` are more or less the same, they both build the maven project to ensure it can be done properly.


`static.yml` is what pushes Q's Javadoc contents to a GitHub pages website.

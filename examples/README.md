# Examples

These examples are meant to showcase various use cases for Q as a language.

There is an example Tic-Tac-Toe game in `/Tic Tac Toe`, as well as a basic `Hello-World` project contained in a folder of the same name.

The most useful of these examples is the `/UnitTest` folder. This project contains many of Q's built in functions, and uses.

The unit test is meant to run through most aspects of Q as a language, and ensure each is working properly.

# Q Key:

**Installation**

Build scripts can be found at `/dwn`, the universal script supports most major linux distros, and macOS. Windows script may or may not work, I don't have a windows machine, so no way to test it.

**Examples**

Some examples can be found at `/examples`, these should work, but some are older, and may have lost functionality as the language changes. Likely will not be updated.
